#1. Prompt the user for a positive integer n. Use a while loop to sum all the integers from 1 up to n. Print the final sum.

n = int(input("Enter a positive integer: "))
total = 0
current = 1

while current <= n:
  total += current
  current += 1

print("The sum from 1 to", n, "is", total)

# i accidentally put a space before print at the end, it took awhile for me to figure out what was wrong
