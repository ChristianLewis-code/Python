# 1. Prompt the user for a word. Then, prompt the user for how many times they'd like that word repeated. Use the skills you learned in this module to print the word the correct number of times.

word = input("what is your word?")
repeats = int(input("how many do you want?"))
print(word * repeats)

#2. Prompt the user for their name and their age. Calculate their age next year. Use string concatenation to print "Hello, <name>! You are <age1> years old. Next year, you will be <age2> years old."

name = input("what is your name?")
age = int(input("how old are you?"))
next_year = age + 1
print(f"Hello, {name} you are {age} years old. Next year, you will be {next_year} years old.")

#3. Prompt the user for a sentence and a word to try to find in that sentence. Have the program print out whether the word was found in the sentence. (i.e. True or False)

sentence = input("insert sentence")
word = input("what word are you looking for, is it there?")
if word in sentence:
    print(True)
else:
    print(False)
# i sort of guessed that one but it worked out, if and else is one good thing i know

#4. Prompt the user for: a word, a first index, and a last index. Slice the word at the indexes provided by the user and print to the screen.

word = input("Enter a word")
start = int(input("Start index:"))
end = int(input("End index:"))
print(word[start:end])

#5. Print 3 words with a | character (called a pipe) in between them. Use the appropriate keyword argument in print() to do so.

print("raw" + "|" + "medium" + "|" + "done")
